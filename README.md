# Terraform Diagramer (TFGram)

Terraform Diagrammer is an open source project meant to allow for the provisioning of infrastructure by diagraming the infrastructure instead of coding the terraform. Diagrams are converted to Terraform and executed by the Terraform CLI. This project is  not even in the Alpha stages yet, but we are committed to being open source and open to input from the greater community
